# CardMaker
Using python to generate LaTeX to create cards using a template

Some people might just use LaTeX straight up (or heaven forbid inDesign),
but me? I like python. 

This road might end up with less code overall,
Or maybe it'll be about the same.

Whatever the case, it's gonna be way easier to interface with spreadsheets this way, so here we go.
